This is a prototype I built to demonstrate how AI can automate the month-end close process at a regulated bank like Square Financial Services. No coding was involved — every feature was built by translating accounting knowledge into prompts. The tool covers 10 modules including CECL reserve modeling, Reg W threshold monitoring, SOX controls tracking, and Call Report preparation.
